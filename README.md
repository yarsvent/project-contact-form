## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

First I created a pure html version of the page, then I began to style the form, added focus states, validation, error states and, finally, a success toast.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS DOM attributes
- Mobile-first

### What I learned

I learned to style forms, radio buttons, checkboxes, and to validate them using JavaScript, as well as how to use querySelectorAll and forEach. I also learned to use icons instead of default radio buttons.

### Continued development

I want to be able to have a better control and knowledge of events, form validation and DOM manipulation.
